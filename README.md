# LiteStreams

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that reduces outbound network traffic.

This is primarily beneficial for users with poor upload speed, metered internet, and/or users that achieve exceedingly high framerates (144+ fps).

## Requirements
- [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader)

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [LiteStreams.dll](https://github.com/Raidriar796/LiteStreams/releases/latest/download/LiteStreams.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
